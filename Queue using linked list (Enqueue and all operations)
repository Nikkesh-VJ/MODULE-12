### Aim: To Type a python code to insert 3 players in the list. Also check and print the index value of the players in the list.

### Algorithm:

STEP 1: Start.

STEP 2: Create an empty list called queue.

STEP 3: Enqueue three elements (Player_1, Player_2, Player_3) using the append() method.

STEP 4: Print the initial contents of the queue.

STEP 5: Use a for loop with range(len(queue)) to print the index and corresponding element from the queue.

STEP 6: Stop.

### Program:
```
queue = []

queue.append('Player_1')
queue.append('Player_2')
queue.append('Player_3')

print('Initial queue: ' + str(queue))

for i in range(len(queue)):
    print(i, end=" ")
    print(queue[i])
```
